Project Requirement Document (PRD) – AI-Powered Shift Planning System
1. Project Overview

We aim to develop an AI-assisted production shift planning system that assigns real employees to production tasks each day while respecting production dependencies, working time models, employee skills, and legal constraints.
The system should maximize efficiency in completing daily production requirements while ensuring compliance with operational and legal requirements.

This project builds upon an existing simplified algorithm-based version but enhances it to handle real-world employee constraints.

2. Objectives

Automatically generate a daily shift schedule for each production area.

Ensure all production processes are completed on time, respecting process dependencies.

Account for employee working hours, time restrictions, and legal rules.

Assign employees only to tasks they are qualified to perform.

Adapt dynamically if available employees cannot cover planned production.

3. Key Production Areas

Preparation Rooms

Start time: 06:00 (fixed)

Example tasks: peeling, cutting, washing vegetables.

Sorting rule: Items sorted by total quantity (kg) ascending within each room.

Filling Room

Core working time: 09:15 – 17:00

Production must be scheduled backwards from 17:00, so last process finishes exactly at 17:00.

Sorting rule: Items sorted by total quantity (kg) ascending.

4. Scheduling Rules
4.1 Sorting and Dependency Logic

Sorting: Items are sorted by total quantity (kg) in ascending order in both preparation rooms and filling room.

Dependencies: An item is only scheduled in a room if all previous processes for that item are complete.

Fallback Selection: If the next-largest-quantity item cannot be processed because a previous step is incomplete, choose the next available item in order.

First Item of Day Rule: The first item in any room must be one that starts its process in that room.

4.2 Time Calculation

Filling Room:

Calculate total time for all processes scheduled in the day.

Subtract from 17:00 to determine start time.

Assign employees to cover from start time to 17:00.

Preparation Rooms:

Always start at 06:00.

Assign employees for the exact total time required (even if < 7.7 hours).

4.3 Employee Assignment Rules

Assign employees only to tasks they are qualified for (based on skills matrix).

Respect employee working time models:

Full-time, part-time, fixed shifts, availability windows.

Respect legal constraints:

Break times.

Maximum daily working hours.

Maximum overtime limits.

If there are not enough employees to complete all tasks on time:

Alert production planning.

Allow redistribution or rescheduling of items.

5. Inputs

The system must accept:

Production Orders for the day:

List of items, process steps, total quantities (kg), and required employees per step.

Process Durations:

Time needed per kg or per batch for each process.

Employee Data:

Name, working time model (start/end times, breaks, max hours).

Skills matrix (qualified processes).

Legal restrictions (max overtime, break rules).

Production Area Definitions:

Preparation rooms, filling room, associated processes.

6. Outputs

Shift Plan Table:

Time slots per production area.

Assigned employees per task.

Task dependencies visibly respected.

Daily Employee Utilization Overview:

Employee names, assigned area, task, and total hours.

Production Feasibility Report:

Confirms whether production can be completed with available staff.

Highlights shortages and suggested adjustments.

7. Functional Requirements

Dependency-Aware Scheduling:
Implement logic to ensure no process starts before its predecessor is complete.

Dynamic Employee Assignment:
Match employees to tasks considering skills and availability.

Automatic Start Time Calculation:
Especially for the filling room, starting backward from 17:00.

Real-Time Adjustments:
Allow reallocation of employees if tasks finish earlier or delays occur.

Reports & Export:

PDF/Excel export of shift plan.

Summary dashboard.

8. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance: Schedule generation in <10 seconds for a full day’s plan.

Scalability: Support 100+ employees and 500+ daily tasks.

User Interface: Web-based, intuitive drag-and-drop adjustments.

Data Security: Employee data must be stored securely (GDPR compliant).

9. Example Workflow

Import daily production orders.

Sort items by total quantity (kg) in each room.

Calculate total process durations.

Schedule preparation rooms from 06:00.

Schedule filling room backward from 17:00.

Assign employees based on:

Availability

Skills

Legal constraints

Generate shift plan.

Validate feasibility and notify if staff shortage exists.

10. Future AI Enhancements

Predict delays and adjust schedules dynamically.

Optimize break times to minimize idle machines.

Suggest cross-training plans to increase employee flexibility.
